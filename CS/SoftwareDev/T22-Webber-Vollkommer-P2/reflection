we added more methods to the Hangman class than originally expected.
the Hangman class's main method was becoming to large. It was easier
to implement and call upon more methods following main.

We decided to create a new and seperate parent class for the AI
files. This allowed for the structure of the player and its subclasses
much clearer and easier to follow. The cutthroat player and the 
AI accept different input than than the methods found in the player
classes and it's sub classes.

We also decided not to have methods that checked for the validity of
the argument in each of the player's subclasses. It reduced redundant code
to make a method which checked argument validity and and method for submitting
arguments in the HangmanBoard.

Changes in the interface reflect changes made in the HangmanBoard.
We also moved the constant of acceptable characters array from the
HangmanBoard class to the Board Interface. We felt that the acceptable
characters was not unique to our board, but should be implemented by all
Hangman boards.

we originnally planned on having functionality to allow for guessing words.
We decided this was unneccesary and overly complicated and drastically
increased the scope of the project. We will probably meet again after
the break to work to add in that functionality to the human player.

we also created our own class which allowed for sending output
to the file and to the console. We decided that it was the easiest
way to gain said functionality.

Over all we feel this was an enjoyable and helpful project.
